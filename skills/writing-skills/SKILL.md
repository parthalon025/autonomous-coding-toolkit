# Writing Skills

## Overview

**Writing skills IS Test-Driven Development applied to process documentation.**

You write test cases (pressure scenarios with subagents), watch them fail (baseline behavior), write the skill (documentation), watch tests pass (agents comply), and refactor (close loopholes).

**Core principle:** If you didn't watch an agent fail without the skill, you don't know if the skill teaches the right thing.

## What is a Skill?

A **skill** is a reference guide for proven techniques, patterns, or tools. Skills help future Claude instances find and apply effective approaches.

**Skills are:** Reusable techniques, patterns, tools, reference guides
**Skills are NOT:** Narratives about how you solved a problem once

## SKILL.md Structure

**Frontmatter (YAML):**
- Only two fields supported: `name` and `description`
- Max 1024 characters total
- `name`: Use letters, numbers, and hyphens only
- `description`: Third-person, describes ONLY when to use (NOT what it does)

```markdown

name: Skill-Name-With-Hyphens
description: Use when [specific triggering conditions and symptoms]

# Skill Name

## Overview
What is this? Core principle in 1-2 sentences.

## When to Use
Bullet list with SYMPTOMS and use cases

## Core Pattern
Before/after code comparison

## Quick Reference
Table or bullets for scanning

## Common Mistakes
What goes wrong + fixes
```

## The Iron Law (Same as TDD)

```
NO SKILL WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST
```

Write skill before testing? Delete it. Start over.

## RED-GREEN-REFACTOR for Skills

### RED: Write Failing Test (Baseline)
Run pressure scenario with subagent WITHOUT the skill. Document exact behavior.

### GREEN: Write Minimal Skill
Write skill that addresses those specific rationalizations. Run same scenarios WITH skill.

### REFACTOR: Close Loopholes
Agent found new rationalization? Add explicit counter. Re-test until bulletproof.

## Skill Creation Checklist

**RED Phase:**
- [ ] Create pressure scenarios
- [ ] Run scenarios WITHOUT skill - document baseline
- [ ] Identify patterns in rationalizations/failures

**GREEN Phase:**
- [ ] Name uses only letters, numbers, hyphens
- [ ] YAML frontmatter with only name and description
- [ ] Description starts with "Use when..."
- [ ] Address specific baseline failures
- [ ] Run scenarios WITH skill - verify compliance

**REFACTOR Phase:**
- [ ] Identify NEW rationalizations from testing
- [ ] Add explicit counters
- [ ] Build rationalization table
- [ ] Re-test until bulletproof
